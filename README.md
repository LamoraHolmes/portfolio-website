# Portfolio Website Project

This is a project I created in order to dive deeper into common DevOps Tools like Terraform, Docker & Kubernetes.

## Parts you have to change

- To use this code you have to change the AWS Account ID "123456789" into your own Account ID.

- Additionally you have to change the config file for Kubernetes to connect to your own server.

- The keys for Kubernetes has to be entered and a password inside the wordpress.yaml has to be defined.
